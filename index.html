							<h2>Product Experience</h2>
							<p> Abby has helped create five different products for EY to bring to market. These are mostly in the Banking sector, but she has also worked on core platform products too. She's proven to be a dynamic problem solver throughout the entire product lifecycle - from product inception through product delivery. She has spent time performing user testing and production ideation, architecting detailed solution plans, delivering products to market, and building the commercial pricing and delivery of a product. Below is a sampling of some of her work. </p>

							<h2>Intelligent Core</h2>
							<p>Abby is currently overseeing the design and build of an EY Nexus product called Intelligent Core. The solution is aimed at helping clients de-risk, augment, and accelerate the core banking modernization journey. Through this work, she has laid out the product roadmap, helped define a strategy to align product build to industry standards like BIAN, collaborated with FinTech and EY Alliance partners like Finxact, and worked with global teams to gather requirements, support client engagements, and build a meaningful solution.</p>

							<h2>Configuration Studio</h2>
							<p>Earlier this year, Abby led a team that built a low-code, no code solution: the Configuration Studio. This product is designed to help non-technical users create user and data experiences in an easy to use interface. The product helps democratize the EY Nexus platform and helps EY teams building on the platform access the components as well as EY Nexus clients. Abby worked in depth with the event streaming architecture to create this solution and has gained an appreciation to the types of experiences real-time technology can enable for use cases across sectors.</p>

							<h2>Skillset</h2>
							<p>Abby's formal education is in Finance and Marketing and it has given her a strong business understanding of how EY clients operate. To bolster her business acumen over the years, she's sought out formal and informal education to become more technically proficient and through practice and working with technology over the past four years she's developed a technical foundation. She's excited to continue learning and feels inspired to continue bringing her unique business and technical perspective to solve challenges. Approaching problems with both lenses has made her a more empathetic listener to understand how to best support clients and create meaningful solutions. </p>
